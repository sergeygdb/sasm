All labs are constructed in such a way you first have to go through them thoroughly and completely before you can start. Only after you have understood everything, you can start with the real work. [1;38;2;153;0;0mYou will fail otherwise, we can't stress this enough!! [0mDon't you dare to do any configuration work or blindly copy and paste commands ðŸ˜œ.
